## 4. Customizing GIMP
>The look of GIMP's interface can be customized like any other GTK+ app.
>
> Editing files in `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/gtk-3.0/` (settings.ini and gtk.css in particular) 
> or by using "themes" (ready-made customizations).
>
> Additionally, GIMP reads `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/GIMP/2.99/gimp.css` so you can have settings that only apply to GIMP.
>
> You can also manually change the keybindings to any of your choice by editing: `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/GIMP/2.99/shortcutsrc`.
